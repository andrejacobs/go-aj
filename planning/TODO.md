# TODO

-   [] Rename OffsetTracked to maybe TrackedOffset, makes more sense
-   [] Check we wrap errors correctly with %w and not %v

-   [] Review all the code before being happy to publish a v0.1.0
-   [] Add github actions to run unit tests etc.
-   [] Review godoc and improve where needed
    -   [] Idiomatic docs.
-   [] Add the addlicense check I use in go-collection.

## Maybe

//AJ### TODO: Create a generic Range type, maybe also add versions for half open etc.

## Done

-   [x] Add a CONTRIBUTING.md. Need to make a template one for small repos like this.
