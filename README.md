# go-micropkg

go "micro" packages are small packages that are being incubated before potentially becoming full blown modules.

Think of this as a repo for utility packages that are not big enough to warrant having a
seperate repo (and all the complexities that come with that) and also I don't want to keep copying the same code
into every project I work on.
