# go-aj

My own go "micro" packages are small packages that are being incubated before potentially becoming full blown modules.

Think of this as a repo for utility packages that are not big enough to warrant having a
seperate repo (and all the complexities that come with that) and also I don't want to keep copying the same code
into every project I work on.

Packages that start with the prefix "aj" (e.g. ajio) contains the prefix to distinguish it from the go standard
library packages.
